# 1. Background
For many people, food is something we need to survive. For some, however, food is something they love
and they are always in search of good food that are affordable and recommended by many.
In Singapore, we have the luxury of enjoying a variety of different cuisines that are made by people of different
cultures and races. All these food can easily be found in hawker centres that house multiple stalls at one location. 
However, the information on some of these stalls, for example, location, opening hours, specialty, etc are not always
readily available on the web. Even if they are, the quality and deliciousness of the food are a mystery, unless it 
is mentioned in the media or on social media. To close this gap, The Hawker-rant provides a platform on which key 
information on these hawker stalls are readily available. Users of this website are able to find information on these
stalls and they can give their honest reviews, to allow others to gauge the popularity and quality of these stalls.
